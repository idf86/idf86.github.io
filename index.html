        <h1>My name is Bug!</h1>
        <p>I'm a simple college student that likes to play games and research bugs (both real and in software :3). I hope to one day do quality assurance for gaming companies! For as long as I can remember, I've been purposely looking for bugs and glitches, to mod games I would manually go into the files and study the directories.</p>
        <p>I like to read about unused content and development builds in video games, and my favourite site to go to is thecuttingroomfloor because it keeps records of those things! If I'm not looking at that, I'm usually watching videos about lost, partially found, and found media. I like to hear about the hunts.</p>
        <p>I also like to read books! My favourite book series is Wings of Fire, but Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles is also pretty cool. Regretfully, I also like Warrior Cats.</p>
