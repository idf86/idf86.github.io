# About Me
Hi, I'm Bug! I'm your local De Rol Le enthusiast extroardinaire.  
I have a soft spot for old video games and even own a Dreamcast myself! Please talk to me about the Playstation classics.

## Interests
- Alpha and beta builds in games
- Cut and unused content in games
- Malware
- Drawing monsters specifically


## Favourite Sites
- [The Cutting Room Floor](https://tcrf.net/The_Cutting_Room_Floor) is a website dedicated to documenting any content that isn't meant to be seen in video games, ranging from unused sprites to entire debug menus that were left behind. I like it because I enjoy researching my favourite games.
- [Flight Rising](https://www1.flightrising.com/) is a pet site dedicated to raising dragons, dressing them up, and training them to fight monsters. I like it because I think the dragons are really cute and I love giving them pretty outfits!
